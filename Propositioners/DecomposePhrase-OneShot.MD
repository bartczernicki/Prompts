Decompose the “ACTUAL INPUT” content into clear and simple propositions, ensuring they are interpretable out of context. 1. Split compound sentence into simple sentences. Maintain the original phrasing from the input whenever possible. 2. For any named entity that is accompanied by additional descriptive information, separate this information into its own distinct proposition. 3. Decontextualize the proposition by adding necessary modifier to nouns or entire sentences and replacing pronouns (e.g., "it", "he", "she", "they", "this", "that") with the full name of the entities they refer to. 4. Present the results as a list of strings, formatted in JSON. 5. Use the EXAMPLE INPUT below as an example of input text and the EXAMPLE OUTPUT of what is expected. 6. Process only the “ACTUAL INPUT” section below with the guidance listed above. 7. Do not provide notes and what you did, just surface the JSON.

EXAMPLE INPUT: Theories and interpretations, Connection to Easter Hares. Content: ¯ The earliest evidence for the Easter Hare (Osterhase) was recorded in south-west Germany in 1678 by the professor of medicine Georg Franck von Franckenau, but it remained unknown in other parts of Germany until the 18th century. Scholar Richard Sermon writes that "hares were frequently seen in gardens in spring, and thus may have served as a convenient explanation for the origin of the colored eggs hidden there for children. Alternatively, there is a European tradition that hares laid eggs, since a hare’s scratch or form and a lapwing’s nest look very similar, and both occur on grassland and are first seen in the spring. In the nineteenth century the influence of Easter cards, toys, and books was to make the Easter Hare/Rabbit popular throughout Europe. German immigrants then exported the custom to Britain and America where it evolved into the Easter Bunny."

ACTUAL INPUT: The New York Mets are an American professional baseball team based in the New York City borough of Queens. The Mets compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member of the National League (NL) East Division. They are one of two major league clubs based in New York City, the other being the American League's (AL) New York Yankees. One of baseball's first expansion teams, the Mets were founded in 1962 to replace New York's departed NL teams, the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants. The team's colors evoke the blue of the Dodgers and the orange of the Giants. For the 1962 and 1963 seasons, the Mets played home games at the Polo Grounds in Manhattan before moving to Queens. From 1964 to 2008, the Mets played their home games at Shea Stadium, named after William Shea, the founder of the Continental League, a proposed third major league, the announcement of which prompted their admission as an NL expansion team.
Since 2009, the Mets have played their home games at Citi Field next to the site where Shea Stadium once stood. In their inaugural season, the Mets posted a record of 40–120, the worst regular-season record since MLB went to a 162-game schedule. The team never finished better than second-to-last in the 1960s until the "Miracle Mets" beat the Baltimore Orioles in the 1969 World Series, considered one of the biggest upsets in World Series history despite the Mets having won 100 games that season. The Mets have qualified for the postseason ten times, winning the World Series twice (1969 and 1986) and winning five National League pennants (most recently in 2000 and 2015), and six National League East division titles.
Since 2020, the Mets have been owned by billionaire hedge fund manager Steve Cohen, who purchased the team for $2.4 billion. As of 2023, Forbes ranked the Mets as the sixth most valuable MLB team, valued at $2.9 billion. As of the end of the 2023 regular season, the team's overall win–loss record is 4,727–5,075–8 (.482).
